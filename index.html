                <p>The idea for this experiment occurred after testing of a rudimentary algorithm back test that yielded an abysmal accuracy and profit score against the dataset. Our team challenged ourselves to find a way to increase Athena’s accuracy over an updating dataset. We continuously augmented and updated the code until we realized the answer was simple- the model should think as a human trader would- albeit without the burden of emotion. Live testing earned us a Top 10 finish in the DYDX Bronze trading league in our first month, and a top 20 standing in the silver league prior to winding down for further testing. Overall, we are quite proud of our back test results outpacing an 8x buy and hold return (we would have gotten 65x).</p>
